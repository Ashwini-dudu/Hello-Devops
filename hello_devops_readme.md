# 🚀 Hello DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Project

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps CI/CD workflow using **Python**, **GitHub**, **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **AWS EC2** with **webhook-based automation**.

It automatically builds, tests, containerizes, and publishes an application whenever code is pushed to GitHub.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

A Flask-based Python application is integrated with a Jenkins pipeline that:

- Pulls code from GitHub
- Installs dependencies
- Runs pytest
- Builds a Docker image on EC2
- Pushes the image to DockerHub
- Stores build artifacts in Jenkins
- Triggers automatically using GitHub Webhooks

# ⚙️ Jenkins Pipeline Stages

### ✅ Checkout
Pulls source code from GitHub repository

### ✅ Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ✅ Run Tests
```
pytest
```

### ✅ Remote Docker Build & Push
Jenkins connects to EC2 via SSH and runs:

```
docker build -t ashwinikum/hello-devops-app:latest .
docker push ashwinikum/hello-devops-app:latest
```

### ✅ Archive Artifacts
Packages application files as tar and stores in Jenkins build history.

---

# 🐳 Run Application From DockerHub

You can directly run the container using:

```
docker pull ashwinikum/hello-devops-app:latest

docker run -p 8080:5000 ashwinikum/hello-devops-app:latest
```

App runs at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

# 🔔 Webhook Trigger Setup

GitHub repository webhook is configured to automatically trigger Jenkins pipeline on every push.

Webhook URL format:

```
https://<ngrok-url>/github-webhook/
```

Trigger Type:

```
GitHub Push Webhook
```

---

# 🔐 Jenkins Credentials Used

Jenkins stores EC2 SSH private key securely:

```
Kind: Secret File
ID: ec2-pem-file
```

Used in pipeline as:

```
withCredentials([file(credentialsId: 'ec2-pem-file', variable: 'KEYFILE')])
```

---

# 📦 Jenkins Artifacts Location

Artifacts are stored in Jenkins build folder:

```
C:\Users\admin\.jenkins\jobs\hello-devops-pipeline\builds\<build-number>\archive\
```

Accessible also from:

Jenkins UI → Build → Artifacts

# ⚠️ Issues Faced & Fixes

### Problem: Jenkinsfile not detected
**Fix:** Renamed `Jenkinsfile.txt` → `Jenkinsfile`

### Problem: Git push rejected (non-fast-forward)
**Fix:** Used rebase + conflict resolution

### Problem: Webhook not triggering
**Fix:** Configured ngrok tunnel and correct payload URL

### Problem: Docker push denied
**Fix:** Logged into DockerHub on EC2 server

### Problem: Port mismatch inside container
**Fix:** Corrected Flask port and Docker mapping
